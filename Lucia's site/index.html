    <p><span>For&nbsp;</span><b>Lucia Russett</b><span>,&nbsp;yoga is a means of self-expression and cultivating compassionate self-awareness. She completed her 200-hour teacher training at Kripalu Center for Yoga &amp; Health in 2013, and is certified to teach Trauma-Informed Yoga by Exhale to Inhale. Before coming to Harlem Yoga Studio, she lived and worked as a social worker in East Harlem for 18 years. Lucia has taught yoga to teen girls, seniors, immigrant mothers, and her neighbors, and is thrilled to be part of the HYS community.</span></p>
